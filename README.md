a sonnet generator


example, generated from the text of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein:

within me a secret i have copies
feature and gesture seemed instigated
continued to search the country parties
learned the ideas appropriated

prescribed medicines and the subsequent blight
that i were to brave men who wished to rouse
innumerable instances which although slight
several hours to live at our house

palaces i had none to participate
he shrieked out imprecations on his rival
thought and misery could not penetrate
insensible to the most delightful

my feelings of indignation delight
contrary but that could tend to excite
