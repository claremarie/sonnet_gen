example, generated from the text of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein:

within me a secret i have copies<br>
feature and gesture seemed instigated<br>
continued to search the country parties<br>
learned the ideas appropriated<br>
<br>
prescribed medicines and the subsequent blight<br>
that i were to brave men who wished to rouse<br>
innumerable instances which although slight<br>
several hours to live at our house<br>
<br>
palaces i had none to participate<br>
he shrieked out imprecations on his rival<br>
thought and misery could not penetrate<br>
insensible to the most delightful<br>
<br>
my feelings of indignation delight<br>
contrary but that could tend to excite<br>
